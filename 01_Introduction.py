# 1.1 History of Python:

# Python was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1991.
# The old name of Python was "Monty Python's Flying Circus".
# Old major version: Python 2 (supported until 2020)
# Latest version: Python 3
# To check your Python version check cmd or open vs code terminal and type 
# python --version

# 1.2 Hello World in Python

# The print() function is a built-in function in Python used to display output.

print("Hello World")       # Single-line output
print('Kamran')            # Single-line output with single quotes

# Handling quotes inside strings
print("Python's")          # Using double quotes to include single quote
print('M "Kamran"')        # Using single quotes to include double quotes

# Multi-line output using triple quotes
print("""(1) Python Basics
(2) Data Analysis
(3) Data Science""")

print('''(1) Python Basics
(2) Data Analysis
(3) Data Science''')

# 1.3 Comments in Python

# Comments are non-executable lines in the code that are ignored by the Python interpreter.

# They are used to explain the code, make it readable, and help others (or yourself) understand the logic.

# Comments do not affect the program execution.
# ----------------------------
# Single-line comments start with hash (#) symbol
# Example:
# This is a comment for Python section 1

# Multi-line comments can be written using triple quotes (''' or """)
