# Python Basics - Topic 2: Escape Characters
'''
An escape sequence in Python is a special character combination that starts with a 
 backslash \ and gives a special meaning inside a string.

 They allow you to insert characters in a string that are normally hard or
  impossible to type (like newlines, tabs, quotes, etc.).

# 1: \n → New Line

# It Moves the cursor to the next line.

# 2:  \t → Tab Space

# Example:

print("Hello\tWorld")


# 3: \\ → Backslash

# It Displays a single backslash (\) in the output.
# Example:

print("This is a backslash: \\")
